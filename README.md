# PhpMonad

### A set of design patterns created with the aim of enriching the Php vocabulary with Literature derived from the functional programming world.

My background is C++/Java/PHP where Functional is synonym of esoteric. In the last projects where I've worked, I always gave talks trying to explain that good quality Software Engineering is a set of practices that could be shared accross functional and imperative programming. I suggest you to read this [blog post](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/03/10/solid-the-next-step-is-functional/) that evidentiates exatly this point. If your code is really SOLID, then, it will definitively looks like functional.
Besides from that, how can you be considered a professional if you don't have a 360 degrees knowledge? 

### Libraries:

[Either library](https://github.com/phpmonad/phpmonad/tree/master/PhpMonad/Either) 

## Help wanted

If you also think that its abetter a value than a variable, you can help us. Propose your library with an exhaustive explanatory README.md.  
Help me as a Functional Evangelist!

Thanks,
